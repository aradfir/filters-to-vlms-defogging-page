# **From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods**

This repository contains the source code for the project page of the paper: **"From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods through Object Detection and Segmentation Performance"** (WACV 2026).

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03906) | [**Code**](https://github.com/prazmara/defog-detection-benchmark) | [**Dataset**](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/)

## **About**

This website presents a structured empirical study benchmarking various defogging pipelines—including classical filters, modern restorers, chained variants, and VLM editing—on downstream autonomous driving tasks.

The site features an interactive **Pipeline Comparison Tool** that allows users to switch between different scenes and configuration strategies (Filter Only, Model Only, Chained) to visually compare results.


## **Credits & License**

This website template is based on the [Nerfies project page](https://github.com/nerfies/nerfies.github.io) source code.

We have modified the original template to include a custom comparison viewer suitable for benchmarking different pipelines (filters, models, and chains).
